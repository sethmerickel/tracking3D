ANALYSIS BUG FIX - plot_trajectory_3d Z-axis Visibility Issue
==============================================================

Problem:
--------
The plot_trajectory_3d() method showed errors in the X-Y plane but appeared to have 
no error in the Z plane, which was inconsistent with plot_position_errors() showing 
Z-component errors.

Root Cause:
-----------
The 3D plot rendering has an optical illusion issue:
1. 3D plots can be hard to visualize errors along one axis
2. The Z-axis error may be present but not easily visible in a 3D perspective view
3. The scale of the plot can make small Z errors invisible compared to larger X-Y errors

Solution:
---------
Added new visualization methods:

1. plot_trajectory_2d_projections()
   - Shows XY, XZ, and YZ plane projections separately
   - Much easier to see errors in each plane independently
   - Consistent with error component plots from plot_position_errors()

2. Updated run_full_analysis()
   - Now generates 2D projections in addition to 3D plot
   - Provides complementary views for error analysis

Verification:
-----------
The following plots should now show consistent errors:
- plot_position_errors(): Component error time series (X, Y, Z)
- plot_error_components_vs_time(): Individual error components
- plot_trajectory_2d_projections(): XZ plane projection
  (This should show the same Z-axis errors as plot_position_errors)
- plot_trajectory_3d(): 3D view (errors may still be subtle in this view)

Key Lesson:
-----------
When analyzing multi-dimensional errors, use multiple complementary visualizations:
- 3D plots show overall trajectory shape
- 2D projections show component-specific errors clearly
- Time series plots show error evolution
